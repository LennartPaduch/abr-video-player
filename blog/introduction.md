# Browser-Based Adaptive Bitrate Streaming: A Deep Dive

## Introduction
When streaming on platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or YouTube, you don't download entire videos upfront. Instead, videos are divided into chunks, usually 2-8 seconds long, continuously downloaded in real-time. All chunks are available in varying aspect ratios, resolutions, and bitrates, using different video codecs to support diverse devices and hardware capabilities.

The Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithm's primary goal is maximizing viewer Quality of Experience (QoE) throughout the viewing session.

QoE depends on three critical factors:
1. Video quality
2. Uninterrupted playback (minimal stalls)
3. Quick initial and seek load times

The core challenge lies in the inherent trade-off: Higher video quality means larger file sizes, increasing stall probability. Conversely, prioritizing minimal stalls requires reducing video quality.

!!! Less bitrate switching is also important for QoE

An effective ABR algorithm balances:
- Network bandwidth
- Device capabilities
- Current video buffer status

By dynamically adjusting these parameters, the algorithm ensures a smooth, high-quality viewing experience across varied network conditions and device types.

While there are open source ABR players such as [Shaka Player](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player) and [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js), most bigger streaming websites have their own media player, developed in-house, because that gives them full control over:
- Performance optimization
- Implementing their own ABR strategy
- User experience customization
- Proprietary streaming technologies and Intellectual property protection
- Advanced analytics

My motivation stemmed from curiosity and a desire for deep technical learning. By developing my own player, I gained an understanding of complex web media technologies. Now, when watching streams on any platform, I recognize the nuanced decisions made during player development, highlighting the unique approaches taken by different teams.
